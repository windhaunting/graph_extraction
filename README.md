# Subgraph extraction

Subgraph extraction is a small program to extract a subgraph with a random subgraph size or differnt hops from a starting graph node.



## Installation  

- python 3.3 or more



## Algorithm Overflow

- Read the graph as adjancy list or edge list
- Shortest path traversal all the potential nodes Or Random walk nodes

- Obtain the subgraph as the query graph
